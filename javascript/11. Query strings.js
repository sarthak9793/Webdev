// A Query string is a part of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that contains data appended to the end of the URL. It is used to pass information to a web server or web application. The query string starts with a question mark "?" and consists of one or more key-value pairs separated by ampersands "&". Each key-value pair is separated by an equals sign "=".Unlike a URL we can apend anything to a query string and it will always be ignored by a given website, server, or API unless they are specifically designed to recognize and process those parameters.
//  Query parameters refer to keys present in the query string of a URL

/* Ex] https://example.com/search?query=apple&category=fruits&page=1
    query string: ?query=apple&category=fruits&page=1 
    query parameters: query, category, page
