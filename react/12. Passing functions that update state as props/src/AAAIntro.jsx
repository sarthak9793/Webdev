// We learned in the previous section that we can pass functions as props and this holds true for any functions, including functions that change state. We pass down a function that changes the state in the parent component and then when we click on the button in child component it calls whatever function it was passed. The function that was passed was a function that changes the state in the parent component. So when that happens there is a re-render of the parent component. 
// This is a very common pattern in react: 1. A parent component defines a function that changes the state in the parent component itself. 2. The function is passed as a prop to a child component. 3. The child component at some point invokes the prop function. 4. The parent component is re-rendered/re-called along with its children components
